    <p>
    The idea behind <code>gittodoistclone</code> is that the developer has created issues in GitHub repositories.  The
    developer then wants to see those issues in <a href="https://todoist.com/">todoist</a> as a way to track them.
    </p>

    <p>
    The preferred way to use <code>gittodoistclone</code> is for a developer to group his/her issues via GitHub milestones.
    <code>gittodoistclone</code> initially creates a project in <a href="https://todoist.com/">todoist</a> with a name that matches the repository name.  For each
     milestone, that has issues <code>gittodoistclone</code> can create a subproject by the name of the milestone.
     The issues then are tasks in the todoist subproject.
    </p>

    <p>
        Via the user interface the developer selects which issues from which milestones he/she wants <i>cloned</i> to
        <a href="https://todoist.com/">todoist</a>

    </p>
    <p>
    If the developer does not want to do the above, <code>gittodoistclone</code> has an <i>All</i> category.  Selecting
    from <i>All</i>> simply copies the tasks directly to the newly created <a href="https://todoist.com/">todoist</a> project

    </p>
